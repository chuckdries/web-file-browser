# Web File Browser
Browse files on your computer from a web browser

Read only for now

### Why would I want to do that?

- easy media browser
- just poking around on a server
- idk I'm a web developer these are the tools I know

I'm going for nextcloud files but with zero configuration. A more feature-rich version of [serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve)
